# PACG (Pathfinder Adventure Card Game) - Digital Implementation

A Unity-based digital implementation of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game.

## TABLETOP GAME RULES OVERVIEW
This section describes the rules for the tabletop version of the game.

### Scenario Setup (FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION)
- Select a scenario and read its objectives and special rules.
- Build the location decks and hourglass timer.
- Distribute characters, starting decks, and hands.
- Place characters at starting locations.

### Turn Structure (CURRENTLY BEING WORKED ON)
Each player's turn follows this sequence:

1. **Advance Time**: Advance the Hour (a special deck of Blessing cards).
2. **Give a Card (Optional)**: Give a card to another local character.
3. **Move (Optional)**: Move to a distant location.
4. **Explore (Optional)**: Reveal the top card of the location and encounter it (see below).
5. **Close Location**: Attempt to close it if it's empty.
6. **End Turn**: Reset hand, recover cards, pass turn.

### Encountering a Card (PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL)
- Apply any immediate encounter effects.
- Attempt the relevant check (acquire or defeat).
- On success, gain the card or remove the threat.
- On failure, apply consequences (e.g., damage).

### Making a Check (SHOULD BE MOSTLY FUNCTIONAL)
- Determine the skill used and the check difficulty.
- Play cards and apply modifiers.
- Roll dice and compare the result to the target number.
- Apply success or failure outcomes.

### Playing Cards
A card can be played whenever the card allows it. Some cards specify when they can be used‚Äîsuch as "before acting," "on a check," or "after acting."

- **During Your Turn**: You may play cards freely between phases (except where timing restrictions apply).
- **During an Encounter**: Cards must relate directly to the current step (e.g., only play cards that affect checks during the check step).
- **One Per Type Rule**: Only one of each type of boon (e.g., weapon, spell, blessing) can be played on a single check, unless a card says it can be played freely.
- **Card Actions**: Playing a card may involve revealing, discarding, recharging, burying, or banishing it, depending on its effect.

Always follow the card‚Äôs instructions precisely‚Äîif you can't do everything the power you're using requires, you can't play it.

## Tabletop to Digital Considerations
Implementing the rules verbatim would kinda suck. These are some considerations I made to make things more enjoyable.

### Action Staging
- Instantly committing any player decisions means no take-backsies. That's no fun.
- In most cases, when someone wants to do something with a card, that action is staged.
- The user can cancel - this unstages all staged actions.
- If staged actions satisfy any current resolvables, the user can commit the actions.

### Turn Structure
- All valid turn phases are available at the start of a turn.
- They must be done in turn phase order. E.g., if the player explores, they can no longer give a card or move.

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS

### Current State
- **Status**: Major reorganization completed, ServiceLocator removed
- **Removed**: Static dependencies (Game class eliminated), ServiceLocator pattern
- **Implemented**: Clean dependency injection throughout
- **Focus**: Incremental architectural improvements without major redesigns

### Layer Architecture
```
PACG.Gameplay    ‚Üí Pure C# game rules, managers, card logic, contexts
PACG.Presentation ‚Üí Unity UI components, display logic
PACG.Data        ‚Üí ScriptableObject definitions
PACG.SharedAPI   ‚Üí Cross-layer view controllers, events, view models
```

### Key Patterns
- **Dependency Injection**: Constructor injection for pure C# classes, Initialize() for MonoBehaviours
- **Events**: `GameEvents` static class for decoupled communication (in `PACG.SharedAPI/`)
- **ViewModels**: `CardViewModel` separates presentation data from domain objects (in `PACG.SharedAPI/`)
- **Card Logic Registry**: Attribute-based card behavior system (in `PACG.Gameplay/Logic/`)

## üöß KNOWN ISSUES & PLANNED CHANGES

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Clean up architectural issues** - Incremental improvements to existing design
2. **Debug runtime issues** - Fix TurnManager.RunEncounter() signature mismatch
3. **Complete partial implementations** - EndTurn() method and boon acquisition system

### Architecture Debt
- **Major architectural issues remain** - Need cleanup without complete redesign
- **Some critical bugs**: Runtime errors preventing full functionality
- **Empty implementations**: Several TODO items and incomplete methods
- **Mixed patterns**: Some inconsistencies from the reorganization process

### Technical Constraints
- **Unity Version**: 6000.1.11f1
- **Build System**: Unity-only (no external build scripts)
- **Input**: Unity Input System package
- **Data Persistence**: ScriptableObjects

## üéØ DEVELOPMENT APPROACH

### Current Focus
**"Get it working, then make it clean"** - Implementing core game loop before architectural perfection.

### Architectural Philosophy
- **Pragmatic over purist** - Clean architecture serves development speed, not vice versa
- **Single Responsibility** - But cohesive controllers are better than micro-classes
- **Layer separation** - Core never depends on Presentation/Unity
- **No premature abstraction** - Build what's needed now, not what might be needed
- **Keep the future in mind** - But don't build ourselves into a corner for later features

### Testing Strategy
- **Manual testing** through Unity play mode
- **No automated tests** currently (solo development prioritizing features)

## üìù CHANGE LOG

### Recent Major Changes
- **ServiceLocator Removal** (commit cda0f10): Removed ServiceLocator pattern, implemented clean dependency injection
- **Massive Rearchitecture** (commit 3dbf50a): Removed static Game class, reorganized into layers
- **Namespace Organization**: Complete namespace migration matching folder structure

### Pending Changes
- Complete turn management without coroutines
- Resolve TurnManager layer boundary violations
- Implement proper state machine for turn phases
